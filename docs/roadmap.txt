Email Flow
--
Student sends email to blaze@mavhousing.com
    ↓
SendGrid receives it (they're your mail server)
    ↓
SendGrid POSTs to: https://yourserver.com/webhooks/inbound-email
    ↓
Your controller processes it → calls Blaze AI
    ↓
You send reply email via SendGrid API
    ↓
Student gets response

SMS Flow
--
Student texts your Twilio number (e.g., +1-555-123-4567)
    ↓
Twilio receives it (they own the number)
    ↓
Twilio POSTs to: https://yourserver.com/webhooks/inbound-sms
    ↓
Your controller processes it → calls Blaze AI
    ↓
You send reply SMS via Twilio API
    ↓
Student gets response

For Email (SendGrid)
1. A domain name

Like mavhousing.com or use a subdomain like mail.mavhousing.com

2. SendGrid account

Free tier is fine for testing

3. DNS configuration

Point your domain's MX records to SendGrid's servers
This makes SendGrid your mail server

4. SendGrid dashboard setup

Tell SendGrid "when you receive emails, POST them to this URL"
The URL is your server endpoint like https://yourserver.com/webhooks/inbound-email

5. An HTTP endpoint in your backend

Just a regular POST route that receives the email data
Extracts sender, message text, and subject
Processes it (call Blaze AI)
Sends a reply back using SendGrid's send API


For SMS (Twilio)
1. Twilio account

Costs money - they charge per SMS sent/received
Free trial gives you credits for testing

2. Buy a phone number from Twilio

Like +1-555-123-4567
This is the number students text

3. Twilio dashboard setup

Tell Twilio "when this number gets a text, POST it to this URL"
The URL is your server endpoint like https://yourserver.com/webhooks/inbound-sms

4. An HTTP endpoint in your backend

Just a regular POST route that receives the SMS data
Extracts sender phone number and message text
Processes it (call Blaze AI)
Sends a reply back using Twilio's send API


The Setup Steps (No Code)
Email Setup:

Register domain or use existing
Create SendGrid account
Add your domain to SendGrid
Update your domain's DNS to point to SendGrid
Configure SendGrid to webhook your server
Create an endpoint in your comms-server to receive POSTs
Test by emailing your address

SMS Setup:

Create Twilio account and add payment
Buy a phone number from Twilio
Configure that number to webhook your server
Create an endpoint in your comms-server to receive POSTs
Test by texting your number


For Local Testing
You need ngrok (or similar tunneling tool)

Your laptop is localhost - Twilio/SendGrid can't reach it
ngrok creates a public URL that forwards to your localhost
Put the ngrok URL in Twilio/SendGrid dashboards temporarily
Now you can test locally


Cost Reality Check
SendGrid Email:

Free tier: 100 emails/day forever
Should be enough for your project

Twilio SMS:

~$1/month for the phone number
~$0.0075 per SMS sent
~$0.0075 per SMS received
If 100 students each send 10 texts = $15
Might be expensive for a student project

Recommendation: Build email inbound first (free), add SMS only if you have budget.
